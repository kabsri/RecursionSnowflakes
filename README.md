# RecursionSnowflakes
Cool recursively drawn snowflakes with a recursively drawn tree in the background.
All the snowflakes have random lengths, number of branches, and colours.
The wind blows the snowflakes in one direction and the wind changes in direction and magnitude over time.
To run in Windows double click the .bat file.
Otherwise run the commands "javac \*.java" to compile and "Java Snowflakes" to run.
